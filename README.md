# CalculatorApp

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript web app. It uses Boostrap 3.3.6 and JQuery 3.2.1. Since there is no back end, you can simply run the app by opening the index.html in the browser of your choice. The page should be fairly responsive as well. This was completed in a limited time.

Future Development Goals: 

- Migrate app to use Boostrap 4 and vanilla JS over JQuery. 
- Results history that allows the user to see previous calculations
- Add the ability to chain calculations
